# This file lists which files should not be pushed by WPE DevKit. Feel free to
# add, remove, or comment lines to change the sync behavior, but note that this
# file will be recreated with the default values if it is missing. There are a
# few additional files, including wp-config.php, which are ignored no matter
# what as synchronizing these files would almost certainly result in an unusable
# install.

# WordPress specific files
# NOTE:
#   WP Engine automatically updates part or all of WordPress under certain
#   circumstances, so generally it is desirable to not push local copies of the
#   WordPress files to a production server. However, in case you do have some
#   specific need to push local changes to production, you can comment out these
#   lines.

# WP Engine specific files
# NOTE:
#   These files are specific to running a WordPress site at WP Engine and would
#   likely result in a broken production site if modified in production (in
#   fact, permissions would prevent modification for many of these files). It is
#   strongly recommended that you do not attempt to modify these files in
#   production.
