# This file lists which files should not be pulled by WPE DevKit. Feel free to
# add, remove, or comment lines to change the sync behavior, but note that this
# file will be recreated with the default values if it is missing. There are a
# few additional files, including wp-config.php, which are ignored no matter
# what as synchronizing these files would almost certainly result in an unusable
# install.

# WordPress specific files
# NOTE:
#   WP Engine automatically updates part or all of WordPress under certain
#   circumstances, so it is likely desirable to pull the WordPress files from a
#   production server so that the local copy of the site matches what is in
#   production. However, in case you do have some specific need to keep a
#   different version of WordPress locally than what is running in production,
#   you can uncomment these lines.
#wp-config.php
#wp-content/blogs.dir/
#wp-content/upgrade/*

# WP Engine specific files
# NOTE:
#   These files are specific to running a WordPress site at WP Engine and would
#   likely result in a broken production site if modified in production (in
#   fact, permissions would prevent modification for many of these files). While
#   some of these files (such as those in /_wpeprivate) would be extremely large
#   and completely useless in the context of local WordPress development, others
#   (such as some of the WP Engine managed plugins) might be useful in rare
#   circumstances to have as a reference for debugging purposes.
